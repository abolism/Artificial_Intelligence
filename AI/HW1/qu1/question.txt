Suppose we have a graph with n nodes, on each node there is a number k where 0 <= k <= n-1.
We index the first node as 0, the next as 1, ..., and the last one as n-1,
if at first the numbers on nodes are scrambled, and we can only switch the numbers of node with 0 on it 
with one of the nodes that shares an edge with this one, find the least number of moves necassary to 
get the graph with unscrambled numbers on each node (for each v k=v)
